* You have to add CORS Unblock extension to your browser.
* You have to add Allow CORS: Access-Control-Allow-Origin extension to your browser. 
* The app is set to redirect back to https://harben31.github.io/project_1/ if code needs to be checked or manipulated Live Server http://127.0.0.1:5500/index.html must be used. The code block starting on javaScript line 54 would need to be commented out and the code block starting on javaScript line 62 would need to uncommented out.

## Launch

## Challenges
* Finding an initial concept and APIs to match was our first hurdle. We ran into several barriers for ideas when the APIs we wanted to use were not free or there were limits to the amount of calls that could be made.
* Once we settled on our concept the authorization process with Spotify (oAuth) was a challenge to navigate. We met this challenge by learning about how the different flows worked. We chose the implicit grant flow as it was the only client side authorization offered by Spotify.
* Figuring out how to work with redirect uris and multiple devs was a challenge. We fixed it by utilizing live server and using their default url for the redirect uri. 
* Live Server did not work all the time for one of our contributors. The only fix was to uninstall the extension and restart Visual Studio Code whenever Live Server was not working.
* CORS was another of our initial road blocks. We were not able to access our APIs until we downloaded CORS extensions (see [Prerequisites](#prerequisites))
